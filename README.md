Time Series Analysis on Store Item Demand Forecasting
### Objective: 
Predict 3 months of item sales at different stores
The dataset is provided with 4 columns:
### date: 
The date of sale
### store: 
This is the store number
### item: 
This is the item number
### sales: 
Sales made on that particular day

### Approach:
Visualise the Time series
Decomposing into trend, seasonal, cyclical and noise components
Analyze the seasonality of a Time Series: additive and multiplicative.
Check stationarity of data - Rolling Mean, ADCF Test(Augmented Dickeyâ€“Fuller test)
Stationarize Time series - first differencing
Plot ACF/PACF charts and find optimal parameters
Build Time series models according to data - AR, MA, ARIMA, SARIMA
Plot Residual distribution
Make predictions
MAPE,SMAPE as evaluation metric
